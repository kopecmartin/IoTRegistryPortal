# IoTRegistryPortal
The main aim of this project is to demonstrate, how could be Internet of Things (IoT) devices controlled/maintained 
and how could be all of the information, provided by them, presented to a user.

The presented way, how it can be done, is to create a web application allowing users to register and maintain their IoT 
devices.

Backend of the portal is implemented in [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - javascript framework of 
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). As a database is used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and
[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) for time series data. Frontend is implemented in React.js using 
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

The application supports registration of users (without any encryption) and registration of devices through API keys, 
which will be generated by the portal.

As the project is only demonstration, to the future, it's needed to implement data encryption, tools for visualisation
of data and for its monitoring (like
[Chronograf](https://influxdb.com/blog/2015/07/07/Announcing-Chronograf-a-data-visualization-tool-for-InfluxDB.html)),
security layer above [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) (or other protocol used for device communication) protocol, ...


## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/)


## Installation
 
 [1.] Install packages: 
 
    $ npm install
     
 [2.] Translate React.js to "normal" javascript by:
 
    $ npm run build
    
 The command will generate `bundle.js` file in `/public/` repository.
 
 [3.] Start MongoDB database and server:
 
    $ npm run database
    $ npm run server-watch
 
 Or by one command:
    
    $ npm run start

 **Note:** after this database stored in `/src/backEnd/database/` is used by default.
 
 After the steps, application is available on `localhost:3000`
 

## Tests
Integration tests for middleware can be run as follows:

[1.] Start test database:

    $ npm run test-database

[2.] Start server:

    $ npm run server-watch
    
[3.] Run tests:

    $ npm run test
    
**Note:** after this, test database is created under `/src/backEnd/tests/database/` directory
by default.
